# UFO Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show the people who are viewing this website the information of when and where did the UFO appear, by using filter criterias which would allows the person to input their own text to get the result that they searched for. 

## Results
Like in the html file, people can just input the date, and country which is USA, then the state, and last the shape of the UFO, to filter the results that they want. 

## Summary
The one drawback that I can think of is probably going to be the creditbility of the data source, but other than that I think that it's a pretty cool and useful website to see.
